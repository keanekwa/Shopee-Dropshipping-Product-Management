# Shopee Dropshipping Product Management

I participated in a Product Management mentorship program organised by [The Product Loft](https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-product-loft/), in conjunction with mentors from Google, Shopee, P&G, and more.

I was assigned a mentor from Shopee, who guided us through the Product Management process. At the end of the mentorship program, we were tasked to complete a Product Management project on Shopee Dropshipping in Indonesia.
